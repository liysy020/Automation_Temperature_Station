This project has 2 parts. The first one is to build a LCD display clock using ESP32, 2x16 LCD module and temperature sensors. It will show the current datetime and the sensor information. You can build as many as display clocks and put that round your building with different type of IoT sensors.
Part 2 is to build a server that collect all the sensor data and present the latest sensor information such as temperature and humility on a webserver. The ESP32 sensors will send data every 2 mins using API calls. API Keys are stored on the server. User can disable / enable any key resulting allow or reject the data being sent from individual sensor.
